This directory contains files related to the input isochrones.
If you will use your own isochrones, you may delete all files in this 
directory and replace them with your isochrone files.  Bear in mind that 
mklib needs the isochrone files in the following format:

mass   mag1   mag2   ...   magN


If you will use the Padua isochrones, or would like some assistance 
interpolating between your isochrones, read on.

This directory contains:

girardi.tar.gz, which contains:
  isocz0[001,004,01,04,08,19,30].dat : Girardi et al. (2002) isochrones
  isocsummz0[004,01,04,08,19,30].dat : EEP tables from Girardi et al. (2000)
  read.me : Girardi's documentation file (from 2000 isochrones)

parse_iso.awk:     AWK script to parse isocz00*.dat into individual files
parse_summ.awk:    AWK script to parse isocsummz00*.dat into individual files
                   (These scripts make one file per isochrone, 
                    and the files conform to the above column format)

cmds.sm:           Plot a CMD triplet for a given isochrone.  Usage:
                   SM> cmds z00*_tt.tt <-- arg is the iso filename stem
                                           (e.g., z008_09.00)

*********************************************************
The webpage of the Padua isochrone group is:
http://pleiadi.pd.astro.it/
Look here for possible updates to the isochrones.
Please note that the EEP tables (isocsummz*.dat) are 
from Girardi et al. (2000); at the time of this writing, 
the summary tables had not been released for the 2002 
isochrones.
*********************************************************

To prepare the isochrones for use with mklib, you must unpack the isochrone
archive and then run the AWK script to separate the raw files into 
individual isochrones:

   % cd SFH/iso
   % tar zxvf girardi.tar.gz
   % gawk -f parse_iso.awk isocz*.dat

This will result in a series of files named zN_tt.tt, where
N=(0001,0004,001,004,008,019,030) specifies the metallicity and 
tt.tt indicates log(age) (e.g., tt.tt = 09.00 for the 1-Gyr isochrone).
These files are ready for use by mklib.

Note that if you downloaded the full version of StarFISH, then this 
isochrone-parsing step has already been done.

If the metallicities and ages provided by the Padua group are sufficient 
for your purposes, then you are done.  If you need to interpolate 
between isochrones to increase the resolution in either age or metallicity,
see the "interpcode" directory, and the "Geteep and Interp" chapter
of the StarFISH manual.
