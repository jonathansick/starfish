Changes for version 1.10:

+ Fixed periodicity in random-number generator, which resulted in noisy
  synthetic CMDs.  Now using "dprand" function by  N. M. Maclaren

+ Added option to use Poisson fit statistic instead of chi^2

+ since the "chi" subroutine has been generalized to handle three 
  different fit statistics, renamed it to "fitstat"

+ cleaned up common-blocks

+ added parameter documentation to include files

+ Improved photometric-error modeling in synth.  Now properly includes
  covariance between color and magnitude errors.

+ Make parsing of input and data files more robust.

+ New empirical isochrone-interpolation program.

+ moved code used in all three programs (sfh, synth, mklib) to
  "commoncode" directory

+ Write current best solution to logfile more often

+ The sfh.sm plotting script is substantially easier to use.


Changes for version 1.06:

+ Changed some real variables in synthcode to double precision.
  This was necessary to avoid roundoff errs in the calculation of
  occupatin probabilities.

+ Removed a kludge in sfhcode/chi.f that ignored empty data boxes.  
  Of course, empty boxes carry information too, so they should not be 
  ignored in calculating chi**2.

+ Tweaked param values in synth.h and sfh.h

+ Testpop: added option to use SFRs in input file, instead of number of 
  stars per bin.

+ Testpop: can now read SFH amplitudes with values >10.0 (this was precluded
  by a restrictive format statement).

+ Added alternate versions of synth and testpop that uses analytical error
  model rather than one derived from artificial star tests.

+ Updated manual


Changes for version 1.05:

+ Updated Isochrone tables to latest from the Padua group.  The newer 
isochrones feature higher age resolution, and the z=0.004 tracks extend
as young as log(t)=6.6.

+ Makefiles moved to code directories.  Now you can just run 
"make" in each of the (libcode, synthcode, sfhcode) directories, and the 
*.o object files won't pollute the main SFH directory.

+ Input files specified on command line.  
Invoke programs with (e.g.) "./sfh < input/sfh.dat"
This way, input files can be easily archived for each run.  Also, this
change means that the programs can now be run from any directory.

+ Removed z=0.006 isochrones from examples, since they weren't used 
everywhere.

+ made test.cmds consistent with iso.dat (z=0.004 goes as young as 
log(t)=6.6 instead of 8.0)

+ made MSTO mags in input/iso.dat absolute mags, so they don't need to be 
hand-adjusted to match data at different distances.
