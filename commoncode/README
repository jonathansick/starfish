This directory contains three source code files which are used by several 
of the StarFISH programs:

+ parseline.c:  C is much more flexible for File I/O than FORTRAN, 
                so we use C functions (callable from FORTRAN programs) 
                for File I/O.

+ utilities.f:  Various FORTRAN routines for File I/O.

+ random.f:     The pseudo-random number generator.


This directory also contains two files (mkgif.sh and pxl2ppm.awk) for
generating images of synthetic CMD files.  Simply copy these files into 
your synthetic CMD library directory, and run './mkgif.sh synthcmd_prefix'.
See the comments in mkgif.sh for instructions on how to modify the
script to suit your synthetic CMDs.
