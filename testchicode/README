  Testchi:  quick computation of the fit statistic 
            for a single model.
--------------------------------------------------

Testchi provides a simple frontend to the fitstat.f subroutine, which
calculates the fitting statistic (e.g., chi-squared) of a given model 
SFH.  You can adjust any of the inputs to testchi and run it to see 
immediately the effect on the model fit.

To compile testchi, just type 'make' in the testchi directory.  This will
place the executable program in the main SFH-1.1 directory, which is 
where you should run it.

To use testchi, adjust the parameters in the testchi input file, and 
run the program:

% ./testchi < input/testchi.dat

The fitting statistic value resulting from the comparison of the data 
and the model is printed to the screen, and the gridbox populations are 
written to the "chifile", for a more detailed investigation of the fit
(see the "grid" directory).  

The parameters that can be adjusted are quite numerous, but here are 
a few interesting possibilities:

+ modify the SFH model amplitudes

+ mask out a region of the CMD to see how it affects the fit.

+ apply a color shift to the data

+ use a different fit statistic

+ use a different synthetic CMD library
