1.  Introduction
-------------------

The starFISH package is a suite of FORTRAN programs designed to
determine the best-fit star formation history of a stellar population.
The package constructs a library of synthetic color-magnitude diagrams 
(CMDs) based on theoretical isochrones and data-derived determinations
of the interstellar extinction, photometric errors, and distance
modulus.  These synthetic CMDs are combined linearly into a composite 
model, which is then statistically compared to observed photometry.  
When the best-fitting model is found, the amplitude coefficients on 
each synthetic CMD describe the star formation history of the observed 
population. 


To use the package, you need:

1. Multicolor photometry of a stellar population.
2. A (preferably empirical) photometric error model, typically 
   derived from artificial star tests.
3. A library of isochrones that covers relevant ranges in age and 
   metallicity (Padua isochrones are included in the starFISH package).
4. Determination of the interstellar extinction and distance modulus.
5. Estimates (or guesses) of the binary fraction and IMF slope.


The package consists of three main programs, and five support
programs: 

+ mklib: constructs a library of isochrone photometry from raw 
         isochrones.
+ synth: constructs synthetic CMDs from the isochrones, applying
         interstellar extinction, binarity, IMF, and photometric
	 errors as appropriate for the data.
+ sfh:   constructs composite model CMDs from the synthetic CMDs and
         performs a chi**2 minimization between model and data CMDs.
         The best-fit star formation history amplitudes are output. 


- interp:  interpolates between adjacent isochrones, to improve resolution
           in age and/or metallicity.  Requires knowledge of equivalent 
           evolutionary points (EEPs) along each isochrone.

- testpop: constructs artificial stellar populations from the isochrones,
           according to a given star formation history. 
           testpop incorporates the photometric errors, extinction, etc. 
           exactly as is done in synth.  These populations can be input
           as a "data" population to sfh for testing purposes.

- repop:   same as testpop, except that the artificial stellar population 
           is constructed according to the SFH output by the sfh program.
           This is useful for checking the quality of the SFH 
           determination by comparing the original photometry to the 
           artificial population representing the best fit.

- testchi: allows one to examine the parameter space of the statistical
           fit by hand.  SF amplitudes and other parameters can be 
           interactively adjusted, and the resulting fit-statistic 
           recomputed on the fly.

- grid:    scripts used to create a CMD image from the best-fit model.
           can also create a chi**2 map of the CMD.

3.  How to use the package:
----------------------------

The package is shipped pre-tuned for the data and isochrones that we 
are using in our analysis of the Magellanic Clouds.  I have attempted
to make the code as general as possible.  Customization can be done almost 
exclusively via the input parameter files.  My intention is that you will 
not have to change the source code, but that is certainly an option.

User documentation can be found in the StarFISH manual 
(manual/sfh_manual.pdf).  Additional documentation for the supplementary 
programs can be found in the README files in their respective 
subdirectories.


4.  Notes on Different Architectures:
--------------------------------------

StarFISH was developed on a PC running Redhat Linux.  It has been 
tested on sunOS, Solaris, OSF, and Linux/PPC.  There are slight 
differences in the fortran compilers for these platforms, but we 
believe we have accounted for these differences in the code.

The FORTRAN compiler and AWK parser are named differently on different
platforms.  As shipped, StarFISH assumes the FORTRAN compiler is
'g77', and the advanced AWK parser is 'gawk'.  These programs may be
called 'f77' and 'nawk' on your system (note: you shouldn't use plain
'awk', only 'nawk' and 'gawk' understand the scripts in the package).
Be sure to change references to these programs as you encounter them.
For example, you'd have to change the $(FORT) definition in each
Makefile from 'g77' to 'f77'.


If you have any comments, corrections, suggestions, or complaints,
please email me: jharris@as.arizona.edu

I hope you find these programs useful.
