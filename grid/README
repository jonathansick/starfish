  mkimages.sh:  Script to generate CMD images 
                from the SFH solution
---------------------------------------------

The mkimages.sh script generates images of each CMD and creates an 
HTML document that displays these images.  This is very useful
for examining the quality-of-fit of a particular model, and for 
diagnosing any problems in the fit.

The images are generated from the data in the chifile output by
sfh. The chifile contains the following columns:
icmd, ibox, Nmod, Ndat, c

where icmd identifies the CMD, ibox identifies the box within the CMD, 
Nmod is the number of model stars in that box, Ndat is the number of data 
stars, and c is that box's contribution to the chi**2 sum.

gridN.index:
------------
Before running mkimages.sh you need to generate a gridN.index file
for each CMD.  The columns are:
ix, iy, ibox

ix, iy are the pixel coordinates, and ibox is the box to which that pixel 
belongs.  

StarFISH ships with default index files for the test setup (grid1.index, 
grid2.index, grid3.index), but you will probably have to construct 
new gridN.index files for your own CMDs.  You can modify mkgrid.f to 
generate the files.


Once you have gridN.index files, open the script in a text editor and 
modify the parameters at the top of the file to suit your needs.
Then run the script like this:

% ./mkimages.sh <output_file_prefix> <chifile>

(e.g., './mkimages.sh c1978 ../output/c1978.chi')
